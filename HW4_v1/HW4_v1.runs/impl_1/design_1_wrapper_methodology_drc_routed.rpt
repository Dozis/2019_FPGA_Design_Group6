TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.055 ns between design_1_i/sorting_0/inst/sorting_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg0_reg[30]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/sorting_0/inst/sorting_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/axi_rdata_reg[9]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.754 ns between design_1_i/sorting_0/inst/sorting_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg0_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/sorting_0/inst/sorting_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/axi_rdata_reg[21]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.816 ns between design_1_i/sorting_0/inst/sorting_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg0_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/sorting_0/inst/sorting_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/axi_rdata_reg[22]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
